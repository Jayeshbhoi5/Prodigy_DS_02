### 📝 Welcome to Task 2 Submission!  
This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 2 of my Data Science internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**. For this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of my choice. I selected the **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle for this analysis.  

---

### 📂 Dataset  
[ Titanic-Dataset.csv ] The dataset is a widely-used dataset in data science, containing passenger details such as demographics and survival status. This dataset offers an excellent opportunity to explore data analysis techniques and gain meaningful insights into historical data.  

---

### 🎯 Task Description  
The primary objective of this task was to:  
1. Perform **data cleaning** by handling missing values and duplicates.  
2. Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.  

---

### 🔍 Analysis Highlights  
- Conducted data cleaning to handle missing values and remove duplicates.  
- Explored relationships between variables such as **gender**, **passenger class**, **age**, **fare**, and **survival rate**.  
- Key insights include:  
  - Higher survival rates among females.  
  - Impact of passenger class on survival (first-class passengers had higher survival rates).  
  - Relationship between age and survival.
